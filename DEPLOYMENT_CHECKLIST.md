## Phase 3: Paper Trading (2-4 Weeks) 📊

### Week 1: Initial Run

**Start paper trading:**
```powershell
python run_paper_trading.py
```

**Daily checklist:**
- [ ] Script running without crashes
- [ ] Signals being received from Telegram
- [ ] Positions opening successfully
- [ ] TP/SL triggers working
- [ ] Portfolio state persisting correctly
- [ ] Logs clean (no critical errors)

**Monitor:**
- Equity curve (should be relatively stable)
- Win rate (target >50% week 1)
- Max drawdown (should be <20%)
- Number of trades (expect 20-30/week)

### Week 2: Validation

**Daily checks:**
- [ ] Check portfolio summary (`Portfolio.print_summary()`)
- [ ] Review trade history (`data/paper_trades.jsonl`)
- [ ] Verify fee simulation working
- [ ] Check for duplicate signals
- [ ] Monitor log files for warnings

**Metrics to track:**
- Total trades: ___ (target: 40-60)
- Win rate: ___% (target: >55%)
- Total PnL: $___ (should be positive)
- Max drawdown: ___% (should be <15%)
- Average trade duration: ___ hours

### Week 3-4: Performance Analysis

**Calculate:**
```python
from trading.portfolio import Portfolio
from config.trading_config import PaperConfig

portfolio = Portfolio(10000, PaperConfig.PORTFOLIO_FILE)
summary = portfolio.get_summary()

print(f"Total Trades: {summary['total_trades']}")
print(f"Win Rate: {summary['win_rate']:.1f}%")
print(f"Total Return: {summary['total_return_pct']:.2f}%")
print(f"Equity: ${summary['equity']:,.2f}")
```

**Validation criteria:**
- [ ] Minimum 100 trades executed
- [ ] Win rate > 60%
- [ ] Total return > 0% (positive PnL)
- [ ] Max drawdown < 15%
- [ ] No critical errors in logs
- [ ] Risk limits never breached
- [ ] Emergency stop tested successfully

**If validation fails:**
- ❌ Win rate < 60%: Review signal parser, adjust TP/SL logic
- ❌ Max drawdown > 15%: Reduce position size, tighten stop losses
- ❌ Negative PnL: Analyze losing trades, improve signal quality
- ❌ Critical errors: Fix bugs, improve error handling

    MAX_POSITION_SIZE_PCT = 0.10  # 10% per trade
    DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT_PCT = 0.05  # 5% daily stop
    MAX_DRAWDOWN_PCT = 0.15  # Lower threshold for live (was 25%)
```
